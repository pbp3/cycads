/**
 * The interface for things that listen to GFF event streams.
 * <p>
 * This allows the GFF push model to run over large collections of GFF, filter them and access other resources without
 * requiring vast numbers of GFF records to be in memory at any one time.
 * <p>
 * The stream includes both GFF records and comment lines. A particular handeler may choose to discard either of these.
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that a particular handler will only be used to listen to a single stream of events in a single thread.
 * Particular implementations may not impose this restriction.
